 *
 *   SCOPE      — the farmer TAPS the plot before he speaks, so this asks for something

 *                The server never scored it either (DfesLensExtractor.cs:15-17 — no

 *   WEATHER    — the app already holds plot weather (ssf.weather_stamps, written on the
 *                same unit of work as the log), so this asks for what we already have.
 *   PURPOSE    — never had a weight, so answering it moved nothing.
 *   CONTINUITY — same.
 *
 * Do not restore any of them without BOTH a scoring weight in DfesLensExtractor AND a
 * founder ruling. Retired, not merely unapproved: an unapproved entry still ships the
 * copy and sits one flag flip away from firing.
 *
 * The forward-looking weather entries (weather.rain_before_spray,

 * what is missing from a record, and both are already content-gated inert.
