 *   - paid     (दिलं)      — what has actually been paid out (finance-consistent).
 *   - advance  (उचल)       — advance money given out, ahead of work.
 * बाकी (owed) is always DERIVED as recorded − paid − advance (see `netBalance`
 * below) — never stored, never re-computed from anything but these three.
